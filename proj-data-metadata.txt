	gridcellid/grid == unique grid cell identifier in study area


element name | class|  dimension contents [row,col,slice] | description
------|-----------|-------|-------- 

G | scalar | -  | number of grid cells in study with BBS data
R | scalar | -  | number of BBS routes sampled over entire time period
T | scalar | -  | number of years of count data
w | matrix | [G,R] | % of route R that falls within grid cell G
C.bbs.df | matrix    | [R,T] | BBS count data summed at the route-level (no grids)
C.bbs.array | array  | [G ,T, R] | BBS count data for each grid-route
bbs.observer.experience| matrix | [R,T] | binary indicator for whether that year/route is observer's first (0=false, 1=true)
cov_1 | matrix | [R,T] |  dummy covar for now (rnorm(n = G, mean=0, sd=10))
nRoutesPerYear | vector | [1,T] |  number of unique routes (rteno) with data by year
