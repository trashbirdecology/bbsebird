where 
	rteno == unique BBS route number (state, ctry, route)
	gridcellid/grid == unique grid cell identifier in study area


All BBS objects will be saved with the following dimensions:
1. Arrays: [rows, cols, slice] ==  [route, year, grid cell]
2. Matrices: [rows, cols] ==  [route, year] or [route, grid cell]


Naming conventions:
1. "C.xxx"  : BBS counts
2. "p.xxx"  : detection/observation process covariates
3. "n.xxx"  : scalars indiciting number of xxx
4. "id.xxx" : unique identifiers for xxx
5. others   : others named to strive for recognizability (e.g., doy=day of year, julian=julian date with some origin)



element name | class|  dimension contents [row,col,slice] | description
------|-----------|-------|-------- 

G | scalar | -  | number of grid cells in study with BBS data
R | scalar | -  | number of BBS routes sampled over entire time period
T | scalar | -  | number of years of count data
w | matrix | [R,T,G] | % of route R that falls within grid cell G
C.route | matrix    | [R,T] | BBS count data summed at the route-level (no grids)
C | array  | [R,T,G] | BBS count data for each grid-route year
p.obsfyearbbs | matrix | [R,T] | binary indicator for whether that year/route is observer's first time ON BBS (0=false, 1=true)
p.obsfyerroute | matrix | [R,T] | binary indicator for whether that year/route is observer's first time ON THAT ROUTE(0=false, 1=true)
cov_1 | matrix | [R,T] |  dummy covar for now (rnorm(n = G, mean=0, sd=10))
nRoutesPerYear | vector | [1,T] |  number of unique routes (rteno) with data by year
